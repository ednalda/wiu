 			<h1>Project Name: WorldSurf</h1>
 			<h2> Project Description</h2>
 			<p><b>WorldSurf.com</b> will be the first web 2.0 surf portal available on devices including mobile. The site will serve as an information portal to the public providing the highest visibility of content on various surf destinations around the world (Homepage Ui). Users will be able to explore detailed information of each destination (Details Ui). Each destination will include “members only” content, providing WorldSurf.com members with bookmark capability, web cam access to the destination, as well as user-supplied “tips & tricks”. Additionally, the web application will incorporate a sign-up section that will allow users to create a free account (Forms UI). With an account, members will have access to the <b>“members only”</b> content for each destination, as well as access to <i>“My World”</i>, the WorldSurf.com content management systems. Here users will be able to add and edit information and photos pertaining to a destination, as well as create new surf destinations of their own (moderated). WorldSurf.com will be the only site of its kind with content created for surfers, by surfers.
